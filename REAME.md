# FLAPPY BIRD

I wanted to learn a little bit about JavaScript video games built with canvas and the whole set of techniques they implement to achieve the goal. I followed this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/0ArCFchlTq4) from [CodeExplained](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo) on how to build the [flappy bird](https://roscianorm.github.io/flappy-bird/) game.
Here is the original [repo](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Original-Flappy-bird-JavaScript) in case you wanna take a look. üòÅ
